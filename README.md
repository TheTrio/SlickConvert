## What is it

SlickConvert is a quick and easy way to convert your video and audio files. Just drag your files, choose the output format, and click Convert. That's literally it. It supports multithreading to make even large video conversions quick. 

## What does it use

Apart from being created using the JavaFX framework, SlickConvert uses a variety of other libraries and software in order to make the best product possible. These are listed below 

1. [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - FFmpeg is a free and open-source software project consisting of a large suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams.
2. [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) - A Java serialization/deserialization library to convert Java Objects into JSON and back
3. [JFoenix](http://jfoenix.com/) - JFoenix is an open source java library, that implements Google Material Design using java components.

## Which version of Java do I need

SlickConvert requires [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html) in order to run properly. Versions below or above 8 are not expected to run because of structural changes in the JRE(Java Runtime Environment). 

## Which OS does it run on

Currently, SlickConvert only supports Windows - anything above Vista should be fine, although Windows 10 is recommended to make use of all of SlickConvert's features.

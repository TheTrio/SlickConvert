## What is it

SlickConvert is a quick and easy way to convert your video and audio files. Just drag your files, choose the output format, and click Convert. That's literally it. 

## Why SlickConvert

Despite the market being full of several video/audio converters, there is a serious lack of software which is both powerful and easy to use. SlickConvert provides users with all the features they need without overwhelming them. This makes SlickConvert perfect for everyday users who're not looking for very advanced features.

At the same time, SlickConvert is capable of handling multiple threads at the same time. Depending on your machine, this might reduce convertion time by a large factor.

## What does it use

Apart from being created using the JavaFX framework, SlickConvert uses a variety of other libraries and software in order to make the best product possible. These are listed below 

1. [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - FFmpeg is a free and open-source software project consisting of a large suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams.
2. [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) - A Java serialization/deserialization library to convert Java Objects into JSON and back
3. [JFoenix](http://jfoenix.com/) - JFoenix is an open source java library, that implements Google Material Design using java components.

## Which version of Java do I need

SlickConvert requires [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html) in order to run properly. Versions below or above 8 are not expected to run because of structural changes in the JRE(Java Runtime Environment). 

## Which OS does it run on

Currently, SlickConvert only supports Windows - anything above Vista should be fine, although Windows 10 is recommended to make use of all of SlickConvert's features.

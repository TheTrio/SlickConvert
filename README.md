<h2>The Project</h2>
SlickConvert is part of the **Slick** series we initiated at **@TheTrio**. SlickConvert is a graphical software, which is used for Video and
Audio Conversion<br />It is powered on the backend by **ffmpeg** , an open source video converter, which can be found <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/"> here </a>
It is the power of ffmpeg, and the Slickness of @TheTrio, and when those two meet, **SlickConvert** is formed
<hr />
<h2>The Code</h2>
**SlickConvert** is coded completely in **javafx 8** and can run on both **Windows** and **Linux**. However, it is not compatible with mac
because, well we don't own a mac. If anyone owns a mac and would like to contribute, we would love to hear you at **TheTrio**
